#  TODO
- not quite happy with resizing
- undo of draw move in spider solitaire
- auto completion of spider solitaire
- auto complete one
- auto complete selected (e.g. on double click)
- add partial moves in undo stack i.e. moves when undone require a further move to be undone too
  e.g. for when undoing a move after a stack has revealed a new card - undo will undo the move and the reveal in one
  go instead of the reveal and then the move in two undo actions
